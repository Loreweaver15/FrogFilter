###ABOUT THIS FILTER:

Originally, this was my personal item filter, and I developed it for, weirdly, medical reasons.  I have clinical obsessive-compulsive disorder, and item filters that hid items drove me to distraction with the worry that I was missing something--so I wrote my own filter, customized to my personal tastes, with the intent of making things pop.
Then I got a bunch of my Tumblr followers into the game, and they started using the filter--and I went into overdrive with improvements and changes.  Eventually, I decided that they liked it enough that I might as well release the filter out into the wild for feedback and improvements; there are still a couple of things I'm unhappy with, most notably the seafoam green of the medium/utility currencies.  I want to find something better than that.  Still, tell me how you think the filter can be improved over at the forum thread--https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2009436/ !
